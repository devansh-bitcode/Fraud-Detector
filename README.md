**Project Description — Fraudster**

*Fraudster is an AI-driven fraud detection system designed to analyze financial transaction data and identify suspicious activity with high accuracy. Users can upload a CSV file, which the system processes through data cleaning, transformation, and detailed exploratory analysis. It generates clear visualizations and graphs to highlight trends, patterns, and anomalies within the dataset.*

*The project incorporates machine learning and AI-based classification models to evaluate each transaction and detect potential fraud. By learning from historical patterns, the system can effectively flag unusual behavior, helping users quickly spot high-risk transactions. Fraudster showcases practical experience in data preprocessing, feature engineering, visualization, and deploying ML/AI models for real-world fraud detection tasks.*
